Individual Assessment 01 - Diabetes Classification Problem
Author: Luu Quoc Nhat

----------

Instructions for Running the .ipynb File:
1. Software Requirements:
   - Python (Version 3.11.0 or older)
   - I suggest using Google Colab, an online editor for Data Scientists powered by Google, since everything is set up at the run time
     You can also use local environment such as Jupyter Notebook but there will take some steps to fully set up.

2. Dependencies:
   - No dependencies are needed

3. Installation and Run:
- For Google Colab users:
   - Login an Google Account
   - Unzip the submission file and upload that folder to Google Drive
   - Open the file Diabetes_classification_problem.ipynb, and replace the path to training and testing datasets
   - On the tool bar of Google Colab, click on "Runtime" and select "Run all"
- For Jupyter Notebook users:
   - Unzip the submission file, then open the file Diabetes_classification_problem.ipynb in the Jupyter Notebook interface
   - At the step "1.1. Install packages", replace the code line "!pip install -U imbalanced-learn" by "pip install -U imbalanced-learn"
   - At the step "1.2. Import libraries", comment the code lines "from google.colab import drive drive.mount("/content/drive")"
   - Replace the path to training and testing datasets by the absolute path of these files in your computer.
   - Once replacing all the paths, select on "Run all" option in the Jupyter Notebook interface

5. Additional Notes:
   - If you have any confusions or problems regarding the environment setup, I am willing to present in more details via student account.
